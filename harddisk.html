                    <p class="text-center text-muted">A hard disk, commonly known as a hard drive, is a primary storage
                        device used in computers for long-term data storage. It consists of one or more rigid disks
                        coated with a magnetic material and housed within a sealed unit. Hard disks are typically
                        installed inside the computer and provide much larger storage capacities compared to floppy
                        disks and other removable storage media. They are commonly available in sizes ranging from
                        several hundred gigabytes (GB) to multiple terabytes (TB), offering ample space for storing
                        operating systems, software applications, documents, multimedia files, and more. Hard disks use
                        spinning platters and read/write heads to access and store data magnetically. Despite
                        competition from solid-state drives (SSDs), which offer faster data access speeds and are more
                        durable due to their lack of moving parts, hard disks remain a popular and cost-effective
                        storage solution for many computing needs.</p>
