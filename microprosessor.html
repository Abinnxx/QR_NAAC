                    <p class="text-center text-muted">A microprocessor, also known as a CPU, is like the brain of a
                        computer. It's a tiny chip made of silicon that does all the thinking and calculations necessary
                        for the computer to work. It reads and follows instructions stored in memory, performs
                        calculations, and controls how different parts of the computer work together. Microprocessors
                        come in different types, with varying speeds and features, but they all do the same basic job of
                        running programs and making your computer work. They're found in everything from laptops and
                        smartphones to appliances and cars, powering all sorts of electronic devices we use every day.
