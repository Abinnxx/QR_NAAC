                    <p class="text-center text-muted">A floppy disk, often referred to simply as a floppy, was a common
                        form of portable storage in the late 20th century. It was a thin, flexible disk encased in a
                        plastic shell, usually 3.5 inches wide. Floppy disks had limited storage capacities, typically
                        around 1.44 MB, making them suitable for storing small files and documents. They were widely
                        used for transferring data between computers, storing software installations, and backing up
                        important files. However, with the advent of higher-capacity and more reliable storage solutions
                        such as CDs, DVDs, and USB flash drives, floppy disks gradually became obsolete and are no
                        longer in common use today.</p>
